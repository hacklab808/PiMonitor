## RPi monitoring tool

This tool is primarily targeted to RPi, but it can be used anywhere else.

## How to use
There's an update_logs.py script in the scripts folder. Use this script with cron to add new logs about memory usage, cpu load etc to database.

Web interface is Django based, so just setup a Django webserver and you should be good to go.
